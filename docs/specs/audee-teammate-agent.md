# audee teammate agent
## Fence baseline
Ciel TestLiveKBQueryFence on 2.1.302: PASS. Team-seat headless run: PASS (on both `~/.claude` and `~/.claude-hack`).
SDK probe on 2.1.302 (Agent SDK 0.3.302): PASS. Auth source: `apiKeySource: none` (Team-seat OAuth). The session env must carry `USER`; with only `PATH` and `HOME` the bundled CLI cannot find its Keychain login ("Not logged in"). PreToolUse hook saw `Read`, `StructuredOutput`; the structured-output tool is named `StructuredOutput`.
Bundled Claude Code (SDK `manifest.json`): 2.1.302. `claude --version` (Homebrew): 2.1.302. Production uses the bundled binary.
